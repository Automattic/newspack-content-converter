# newspack-content-converter
Plugin which mass-converts pre-Gutenberg Classic HTML Posts and Pages to the Gutenberg Blocks.

### Disclaimer

Please make sure to back up your site contents fully, because this converter updates the content permanently by replacing the classic HTML content with Gutenberg Blocks content.

The plugin is presently in Alpha, and used primarily as a Developer's tool -- please check back for a full and improved version soon.

### Development
